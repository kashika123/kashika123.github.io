                My film festival poster wil be named as THE ROCKZILLA FILM FESTIVAL  <br><br>It will be composed of figures, characters, animals and attractiveness will be in regards to the use of colors within the logo name design.<br><br> My unifying factor is, Dwayne Johnson, who is both a dual-roles specialist, that is, he always performs well in
both Adventurous and Action Mix-comedy movies.

                     THE ROCKZILLA FILM FESTIVAL has been selected because this name is matching with unifying factor i had choosen who is Dwayne Johnson and who is also
known as THE ROCK .<br><br> However, as Zilla means to be a giant monster, i had combined THE ROCK AND ZILLA together to make it becomes ROCKZILLA which depicts my unifying factor because of his personality, strength, huge body and appearance.
                        
<br><br>My target audience for this movie film festival is evolving around an age sequence of 18 - 30 years.<br><br>

                  <p>Typography: THE ROCKZILLA is in Bold colours of RED and
GREEN with an illustration of an eye.<br> <br>Since the Actor is mostly engaged in Action movies, where there is need to be full of power, I made the Rock typeface in Red color,
as it determines the level of power and strength that is required
for each movie to even rock the stage and the green colour is to
represent the adventure of THE ROCK in his movies. <br> <br>
The design of the logo is made clear such that within a poster
with a considerable number of wordings, this logo can be clearly
seen in a competitive way from other typefaces.<br> <br>I selected an Eye shape to represent the “O” in the Logo. I used this eye to represent the way the Actor sees things, comprehend
and react according to different situations.<br> <br> The wave on the Eye
represents 2 things:
1. The Power
2. The wavy format represents the level of difficulty to perform
individual fight scenes, from the left, maintaining constant arc
shape, and to the right, showing a rise in difficulty.

                    <p>For my line up poster final digitally based on the two choosen films and also other films which will be played during the film festival. <br><br>The silhouette figure is to give a view of my unifying factor who is Dwayne Johnson and i have drawn animals all around because most of the time , films of Dwayne Johnson consists of different animals with different story.<br><br> There is a drawn planet Earth also to showcase that in most of his films evolve of having saved the world also through different obstacles.
                      
                        
                        Moreover, I used a series of animals sketches made in my 20 concepts, merged
them all in Adobe Illustrator where I digitally mounted them on the name logo, where with a gradient effect, I managed to make the contour appearance of the world. <br><br>This shows that those animals are notably found in every part of the world, here the tagline is the world of zoo. <br><br>The birds are colored in a solid way in yellow since to me, is that the birds fly during the day, when there’s light, and yellow color represents the sunlight reflection. <br><br>The tiger illustration on the Globe is made since it shows that in an adventurous situation. Green color shows the landscape around, and the main tiger represents the wish of prey for other organisms visiting or disturbing their natural habitat.

                  <p>My poster for Journey 2, is focused on imaginative thought, in which many events can happen at once, whether it be adventurous or comedy or seriousness in situations which are based on action.<br><br>Journey 2 is set to be mostly adventurous because of the junglelike colors that I used to use improve the poster. The background has been changed into light blue, so that the Bird can be clearly seen with a 3-dimensional follow-up path for the characters on the Bird’s beak, showing the hardship they face in achieving their goals.
             
                      <br><br>
                     The new Algerian typeface for this poster is red, showing strength. The green color refers to the greenery that makes the jungle-like way a natural habitat for certain creatures, and the actor’s chasing environment. The stroke I used shows the continuity of the Actor’s paths to move to reach his destination within limits, since the stroke acts as a boundary.
                      
                      <br><br>
                      Grid System uses the letter “Z” to be able to follow the audience
Where to first look. Then Hierachy contributes the guidance too.
The date and time color on the poster is in green and red because the film is a mixture of adventure that means green is about the natural environment in the film and red is about the power.

                    <p>Jumanji is comprehensive and built in such a way that, in terms of motions creation and execution, it reflects how hard those steps are.<br><br> My film poster is going to have this intense Tiger structure , which means two things.<br><br> First, it involves the level of strength, both naturally and mentally, that Dwayne Johnson has.
                        <br><br>The title typeface (Broadway FONT) remained the same for the poster because it reflects the power outages that the Actor may see anywhere that reflect the production of the movie.<br><br>The color of the date information and the title of the film have also been changed to white to provide some positive contrast and make the poster readable and appealing.<br><br>
                      It is seen in the poster that the names are represented in a bolt pattern, and it will hit the viewer’s eyes because there is a logical idea behind it, that reflects the risky and fast-related actions that will be shown. <br><br>However, the new changes about the illustration has been done where the refinements of my illustration has been done by having drawn the teeth of the tiger and also rough mountain which seems to be reflected in the right side
