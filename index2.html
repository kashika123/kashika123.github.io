                   <p> GreeNaze’s brand is totally dependent on photography, which is used to promote and market their property to clients through mediums such as billboards, sale signs, flyers, magazines, and the company’s website.<br><br>As you can see in the final deliverables, there is a lot of imagery that features GreeNaze’s surroundings, architecture, and interior items. To attract visitors, it’s necessary to use references in the styling and use attractive photos.
                          
                          
                          <br><br>The muted colour palette was chosen to make viewers feel more connected to nature. Through the branding, a muted tint has been added to some apps to establish a tone of tranquilly, relaxation, and stability, which is exactly what Minimalist design aims for a regulated and organised relax place.<br><br> Green and yellow were chosen because it is important to remember that this is a place where people can rest, so the colour combination should be delightful and appealing to both parents and children. </p>
