                  <h4>LOGO AND COLOUR</h4>
                  <p>
                 The logo and the restaurant name are the principal means of conveying the tone of speech. The name Flam.In.Go combines simplicity and creativity to attract customers straight away.

                  <div class="">
                    <p>The prime logo of the Flamingo bird, the Flamingo flame and the Flamingo burger is the true taste of the burger, alongside the innovative personality of the brand, in accordance with the modern look and imaginative approach of the brand. <br><br>In this illustration, the color yellow was used to reflect the flame. <br> Hence, the spiral pattern is used to represent the ovarian cycle, menstruation cycle which a period of purification and growth<br>
                        The pink color was chosen because it is the original bird color of the name of the hamburger.<br><br> Another reason to wear pink, according to Rose “as a flamingo, the pinker you are, the healthier and better you are” (Ling 2021). <br>This gives consumers an idea of the hamburgers and that the hamburger provides healthy burgers with high-quality services, because flame and grilled burgers are seen as more healthy.</p>

                    <h4>THE PROBLEM AND SOLUTON </h4>
                  <p> It has been a bit time consuming also as i had different names before coming to this "Flamingo" name. I had to make a minimalist approach for the logo as well i had to spend time to be able to design the packaging boxes of the hamburger in a friendly and attractive design which will stand out differently from other hamburgers. <br>
                 <br>
                      
                      I had even used different colours for the logo and for other deliverables which i had changed later as per feedbacks given. Thanks to feedbacks given i had been able to come up with a different colour palette and change the previous one as shown because the colour palette was red and black which make the brand seems aggresive instead of friendly. 
                      
                      
                      
                     
                <br><br>
                      
                      
                       From the logo to illustrations of pattern , i have used illustrator to design various logos, patterns, menu cards, burgers and box packaging using shapes, and pen tool to come up with some digital ideations to be able to proceed with my finals and change the colour palette and other deliverables below.

                  <h4> THE PROMOTIONAL POSTER</h4>
                  <p>
                The promotional touchpoints were planned to include a flyer that promote 50 per cent off burgers throughout the day to promote the official launch, which offer consumers both encouragement to come and to try the grill styles of Flam.In.Go.<br>
               The promotional flyer was designed to unify the voice tone of Flam.In.Go. The logo colors were used for the brand. The Run Demo typography is also used in the promo flyer, as they give the typeface a warm and spicy character that allows customers to try Flam.In.Go. The promo flyer was kept fresh and precise and plays to the healthy side of Flam.In.Go, as nothing seems fast food or mass produced.<br><br></p>
                 <h4> THE MENU CARD</h4>
   <p>The menu of the table was developed to also be a placemat.
A colour of the logo is used as the pink border; and the phrase at the top of the menu underlines the playful tone of the voice with its own picture and pattern. </p>

                  <h4>THE PACKAGING DESIGN</h4>
                  <p>
                 When compared to other burger boxes, the burger box has an unusual box design. Each side was correctly branded, with some having patterns and others having text, so that the burger box served as a cohesive contact from Flam.In.Go. Color consistency in typography, as well as patterns, are essential on the information side.<br><br>
                    The  exterior of the burger box is designed by having the
logo with its pattern and information about its opening hours and day to attract people and be visible for people to get to know about the enterprise availability with another information of “HOT.SPICY.SMOKEY.TASTY” which depict the quality of grilled burgers is available<br>   
                  
                      </p>
                    
                   
                    
                  <div class="">
                  <p>
                The intention is to create Flam.In.Go concept collateral reflecting their ideals to create an exclusive burger based on their preferences.<br><br>
                 In summary, all forms of communication must reflect a clear vision and direction of the brand, including modernity, hygiene and expertise, speed and affordability.
The objective is therefore to create an unforgettable experience in the minds of its customers in order to combine something special and attractive with the food.<br>
