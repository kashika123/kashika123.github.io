                The individual project is based on this mobile app named “My Local Services” in which we were required to add a new A new recycling feature, for our existing target audience which is families with small children to provide them with creative ideas as to how certain items can be recycled for home and everyday use where the users will feel confident that they are helping to create a longer-term future, while at the same time exercising their creative skills.

                Hence, before designing the new feature it is important to analyse the consistency, Visibility, Match between system and the real world of the interface in terms of the typography, content, colour, User control, design process and it’s Effective Interaction Points.

                    When an arrow on the right side of the page is clicked, it opens a new interface, as shown in the image. The “waste” and “push” functions also
provide the user with “push notifications” the night before
the collection and activate lightning, which is displayed in
the user’s lock screen as a reminder the next morning. <br><br>  The
right side arrow and the push notification button represent
the universal design principle of informing users that the
application is operational.

                  <h4> SOLUTIONS </h4>
                  <p>TO be able to come up with the new feature, an icon is required to design to implement in the app for the users to know that this icon will meet their expectations to be able to recycle items in a new creative way in their daily life and also be able to make money through it or even buy items which are posted for recycle at cheap price which might be useful to others.<br><br>
             
         The first thing to be able to do mnemonics , it
is important to create an icon for the new feature
which will meet the expectations of the users and
for this a mnemonic on the topic is needed to come
up with a new icon and a name of it.
                      
                      
                      <br><br>
             
                      
                      
                      As a result, the icon is called Renovate, which is
another word for “recycling.” Renovate was chosen
because it sounds new and modern, similar
to recycling old things into new things.
                      
                                       <br><br>
                        
                        
                        The “Renovate” button icon the users will click, it will be opened directly
to that specific interface, with other options such as camera scan, DIY
videos and DIY images, trash games for the people to be able to develop
their creative skills according to the specific product they want to
renovate by themselves

                    The Next step of the project was to design interface layouts for the app which can match with these solutions <br>  - Should be accessible to all users<br>
-it is useful for over the years for any age group<br>
-the app is accessible both online and offline too<br>
- it will have constant update over the upcoming<br>
years (people can have their bonus too)<br>
-there will be options for children and adults to be
able to use the app<br>
-the app will in interactive and user friendly<br>
- The feature is not complicated<br>
-Easy to use with right information and flow<br>
- It is not time consuming<br><br>
                        
                      The sketches layouts are made simple with simple interface in order to keep the consistency of the app like it was and for users not to get confusion. It is just the the new feature will have different options through which the users can explore many things. However, after this step, the step of storyboard takes over where I had to select different interfaces and merge them together in order to have a prefinal outcome which i had made two storyboards.

                  <p>
                        Here is the different screens interface of the Recycle app namely, My Local Services and I have used Adobe Xd to create the mobile interface for the new feature.This pictures demonstrate each screen with its description alongside explananing the flow. <br><br>
                      
                     As we can see, the entire application interface is a red
theme with just six main characteristics at the bottom,
which is very minimal. No useless feature or button is
present in the ui.  <br> <br>
                      
                      Text in white, highlighted options in
red, the color pallet is very consistent. 
                       You can access
the “Renovate” interface by tapping on the icon in the
icon bar below.  
                      The icon is very minimal and straight
forward. The usual icons and direct menu help to keep
the experience memorable.  <br>

they will turn red to let the users know which options they

                  <h4> How the Mobile Medium Affects
the User Experience?</h4><br>
                    
                  <p>The fact that this app is mainly made to use touch-based devices, a simple red
and white interface, as user-friendly user interface. It leads users in an easy way.
                      
                      
                      <br><br>
                      
                      It cannot therefore be argued that today people don’t like
pollution, money wasting, so this new feature helps them
to renovate their minds and old objects, but instead creates
something new instead of buying something new. It’s now
a recreation activity. The user is therefore satisfied by the
experience with the app. In the app, too, there are games
that remind little kids to memorize and learn about
recycling, and it looks super interesting.
