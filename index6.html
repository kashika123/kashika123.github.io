                Mo’Zepices Savories is a cookbook that gives the readers a hint about the cookbook that it will be a mixture of spices and desserts. Mo’zepices is meant as “my spices”.<br><br>
                     This name has been formed in order to give the personally feeling of the cookbook of using “my spices” which gives the essential feeling of using local spices of Mauritian Spices for desserts. Hence, the word Mo’Zepices gives the pun of “MAU” which is Mauritius spices. <br>

                  <h4>THE GOAL </h4>
                  <p>
                 The goal of Mo’Zepices Savories is to offer methods for readers to make excellent desserts
with spices, as spices are a natural medicine that can be found in almost everything we eat.
Its goal is to help people who are self-motivated and eager to learn. Whether for personal or
professional reasons, Mo’Zepices Savouries aspires to educate its readers how to cook and
bake spicy savouries that aren’t too spicy, and instead provide a proper guide on how to use
each spice to prepare particular sweets.

                  <div class="">
                    <p>Mo’Zepices Savories’ secondary goal is to provide people with healthy, tasty, and visually
appealing dessert recipes. Mo’Zepices Savories can also encourage people to make good
lifestyle choices as a result of their use of this cookbook. <br><br>The Masthead of the cookbook is Berlin Sans FB Demi font. i have used it to give a professional and appealing
look on the cover by having an innershadow in order to make look visible and have a contrast between the masthead and background.  </p>

                      <p> Pack a lot of recipes into a fixed page count and trim size already determined and budgeted — while conveying the appealing beauty of the desserts and at the same time designing the layout to be an easy-to-use go-to cookbook.

                    <h4>THE PROBLEM</h4>
                      
                       <p>
               I've always known that the finished desserts' visual appearance would be crucial to the cookbook's style and it is here that the problem had arise for me as i was not a good photographer.<br><br> I had to figure out about the lightening, angles to be able to take a picture and also able to arrange the necessary desserts and spices.<br> <br>I had to figure out how to edit and design a good layout also for the cookbook to be able to adjust the pictures along with the recipes.<br> <br> As Cooking could be a stressful activity. You're frequently juggling multiple tasks at the same time, such as preparing several dishes, gathering ingredients for each, cleaning utensils that need to be repurposed, coordinating prep and<br> <br> cooking tasks so that everything is ready on time, greeting guests as they arrive, and dealing with a variety of other distractions.<br> <br> Hence, the layout should be in a simple way for the readers to be able to cook and follow the steps of cooking.

                  <h4>THE SOLUTION</h4>
                  <p>
                   With the use of Photoshop, i have been able to adjust some lightening and edit the pictures to make them look presentablein the cookbook. <br><br>As artistry is extremely important when it comes to photography. It lays down a distinct and attractive way in which the product is
presented.<br><br> It attracts visitors and shows the beauty of the item. The pictures in the catalog must work well.
This meant that research into food photography was useful for a number of purposes. <br><br>It helped me to get to know the subject and
how to approach this photographic form. In this study I learnt how to use Decorating tools to manage lighting, styling and
nourishment plate, edit variations and certain simple but important things.

                    <h4>THE INTRODUCTION</h4>
                  <p>
                The food is presented to the reader in the introduction of a recipe. Why is it so great? It's ideal for a variety of occasions. Where did the recipe originate? Perhaps a hint on how to make a great decoration or how to utilise it in a different way and also about the benefits and importance of each spices which will be showcase in the cookbook as well.

              </p>
                    <br><br><br>
                  <h4>   THE RECIPE </h4>
     
              <br>
                    <h4>  Hierarchy</h4>
  <p>In the hierarchy, the viewer is easily handled concerning readable notes, since I am the one leading the readers to that particular segment.<br><br> The typeface itself has an attractive sense of visual identity as well as psychographic response and an invitation for the rest of the cookbook to open it in the hope of finding something interesting to him or her.</p>
                    <h4>  Typography</h4>
                  <p>
The typography in the cookbook is bold and exciting, but it must be nice and attractive instead of excluding. The 12pt Italics of ClementePDan
Bold is based on the audacious and eye catchable headings, which makes it easy to read and welcome Roboto. <br><br>The 10pt type was used to keep
a whole recipe readable, allowing sufficient space for one page. The text was aligned, but not guaranteed to make the view look easier and less
business-friendly at a glance.
                  
                      </p>

                  <h4>Result</h4>
                  <p>
                  The final book turned out beautifully with a simple and elegant, readable layout. <br><br>As the images of spices in a cookbook are generally in different colors in so far as they are the dominant color that evokes the desire to eat and
gentleness. It separates the book from being linked as a health book, but it is quite exciting and demanding.

delicious desserts but also by translating and decoding the recipes themselves, as well as by learning how desserts should be made with unique
           spices and their advantages.</p>
