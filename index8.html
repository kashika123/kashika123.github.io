                  Brand Personality - Fashionable | luxurious | innovative | professional<br><br>
                  The brand personality will consist of fashion, luxurious, innovative, and professionals as it would make the product as well as the brand unique on its own.

                      The “Miss Me” logo is a boutique for women’s clothes. Since my target demographic is just the gender of women, it targets both older women and young girls who enjoy shopping. All will find their true self “me” in the mirror in the changing area.   <br><br>The women’s clothing shop has all kinds of clothes available, whether they are unemployed, or retired, disabled. You will feel again if you ever “miss” your old self. That’s why this name was chosen to let the target audience experience the nostalgia of shopping in the store. They are purchased by the brand. Therefore, behind this brand name the word ‘miss’ plays a double role.

                  The logo is a pattern itself as the form of the lines hold a big definition. The M was inversed and seen as W are merged which gives a new definition to the logo .

                  <p>The ultimate goal of the boutique is to have a connection focused on shared and reciprocate contact with my clients in order to make a product / art that is happy and allows them to make their dream tattoo come true.Hence, working on theses deliverables has helped me to expand my business and also to attract clients and their trust.<br><br>
                In another way, the shopping bag acts as a conduit for the organization, so the cart is shipped around the market and increases brand awareness. Thus, it is easy to identify the brand from the design on the shopping bag.

                      The packing process requires wrapping paper, too. The reason behind the wrapping paper is that every product is carefully wrapped and the product is therefore clear to the customer as supplied.

                  <p>As a consistent message of MISS ME and their tone of voice, the promo advertising poster was designed.<br> To convey diverse words and notifications, the colour palette and typography were combined with noticeably thicker type (again presenting the fun tone of voice and referencing the logo).<br><br>

The promo advertisement poster was maintained clean and clear, which plays to the MISS ME nostalgic side, in order to generate a sense of trust and familiarity in the consumer's mind (as is the objective with most businesses) by include the website link as a call to action and its promotional sale.

                      <p>The signage was an attraction, so the logo was sleek to reflect the company’s sleek attitude. The use of a typical sign style for the project would not have been so effective, since the goal would be to display the company name and brand logo easily. The purpose of the sign was to separate itself from other signs nearby so that by using a glistening sign more people could be seen during the day or the night. Thus, after the study, I changed the mock of the signals and highlight professionally the logo and brand. Signage shop illumination and visibility aim to create differentiation and efficiency to attract buyers in the immediate vicinity. </p>
